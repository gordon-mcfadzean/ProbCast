}
\arguments{
\item{mqr}{A \code{MultiQR} object to be re-scaled}

\item{mult}{Multiplicative adjustment of length 1 or with length equal
to the number of rows in mqr.}

\item{add}{Additive adjustment of length 1 or with
length equal to the number of rows in mqr.}

\item{order}{Order in which to perform adjustment, either
\code{"ma"} (multiple-then-add) or vice versa.}
}
\value{
A \code{MultiQR} object.
}
\description{
